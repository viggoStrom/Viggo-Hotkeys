# My Hotkeys

## Description
I am a real power user, and often the OS doesn't provide everything I need to do my best work, so I decided to create my own hotkeys. I have used [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) for mine.

## Installation

1. Have [AutoHotkey V1](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.

2. Run the following command in PowerShell:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viggoStrom/Viggo-Hotkeys/refs/heads/main/install-ahk-v1-version.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
./install.ps1
```

- It will download the install script and run it. The script then downloads the hotkeys and places them in the startup folder.
 
## Hotkeys

- `Ctrl + Q`: Web search selected text (DuckDuckGo as default search engine)
- `F3`: Browser back (Hold Alt to ignore)
- `F4`: Browser forward (Hold Alt to ignore)
- `Win + Space`: Non-breaking space
