# My Hotkeys

## Description
I am a real power user, sometimes the OS doesn't provide everything I need, so I have to create my own hotkeys. I have used [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) for mine.

## Installation
1. Have [AutoHotkey V2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.

2. Run the following command in PowerShell:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viggoStrom/Viggo-Hotkeys/refs/heads/main/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
./install.ps1
```

## Hotkeys
- `Win + C`: Open Web Browser (Firefox as default)
- `Win + Z`: Open Visual Studio Code
- `Ctrl + Q`: Web search selected text (DuckDuckGo as default)
- `F3`: Browser back (Alt to ignore)
- `F4`: Browser forward (Alt to ignore)
- `Win + Space`: Non-breaking space
