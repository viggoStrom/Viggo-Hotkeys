# My Hotkeys

## Description
I am a real power user, sometimes the OS doesn't provide everything I need, so I have to create my own hotkeys. I have used [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Installation
```bash
wget https://github.com/viggoStrom/Viggo-Hotkeys/blob/main/install.ps1
./install.ps1
```
